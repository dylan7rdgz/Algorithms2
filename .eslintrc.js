/*
    Set of Rules picked up from JavaScript - The Definitive Guide

    1. No colon after after right parenthesis of a for loop, while loop, or if statement;
    2. Use for/of with Object.keys() instead of for/in while looping through objects;
    3. Avoid the with statement
    4. Use Strict mode - for more details see pg. no. 123 of the book.
    5. Avoid using declarations with var
    6. Use Typed arrays wherever possible
    7. If there is a chance to use function expressions instead of function declarations
    8. Use Arrow functions
    9. Note that, when writing an arrow function, you must not put a new line between the function parameters and the arrow
    10. Predict when params passed to a function are a lot and difficult for the caller to remember - Suggest Destructuring
